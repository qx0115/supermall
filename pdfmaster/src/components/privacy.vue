             </span>
              <span class="agree_content_body">
If you create any paying PDFMaster account via our website, we store data about your account in a database on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). This includes your email, name and address if you have added them in your profile. To include an additional level of security, we use cryptographic hashing to save your password. This directly implies that our employees can’t see it. We also save the plan you are on and whether you have paid with PayPal, a credit card or other payment methods, your VAT number, type of credit card or payment method information, last 4 digits of credit card, IP address, user settings, company, role, industry & employees size.
For security reasons we also save the time, browser and IP address of your last login and the time of your last password reset.

              <span class="agree_content_body">

Any personal data you provide to PayPal will be processed by them in accordance with their privacy policies. Please review their privacy policies in order to understand what types of personal data they collect from you and how such data is processed.
Your full credit card number will never reach our server and will always be sent directly to Paypal your computer. We can only see the first and last 4 digits of your credit card.

1.3 Errors and Improvements

             </span>
              <span class="agree_content_body">
We use TrackJS to discover possible javascript errors when you use our service. If an error is detected, we save this along with your browser, operating system, screen size and IP address.
We have our own custom analytics system. Here we save for example the pages which you have visited, the tools you have used, and which options you have chosen on our tools as well as the options during the signup process. With this, we store your browser type, operating system, your default PDF software, number of processors, your RAM, country and file sizes. On our mobile app we store additional information about how your file was created and which device you are using. All this helps us to identify errors on our site, our mobile app or our desktop app, areas that are used frequently, and things that should be improved.
In order to analyze how users access our website, understand web traffic, and determine targeted advertisements based on your preferences, some of our services use cookies. 
To improve your experience on our desktop app we track and store your operating system, the number of CPU cores your computer uses, your computer memory, and which PDF reader is your default. </span>

          <span class="agree_content_title">
        3. What does PDFMaster use your personal information for?

           </span>
            
              <span class="agree_content_body">
                In brief: We use Your Personal Data to provide you with high-quality services. Your privacy is our priority. We would not use Your Personal Data for unlawful purposes.
We log your IP address and other usage metrics for administrative and analytical purposes, all with the goal of improving our services.

           </span>
           <span class="agree_content_title">
        4. To whom does PDFMaster disclose Your Personal Data, and why?

           </span>
            
              <span class="agree_content_body">
                In brief: We share some of Your Personal Data with others in order to provide you with our services. Don’t worry, we will not sell Your Personal Data or give it to spammers.
PDFMaster will never share Your Personal Data with any Third Party business organisation that intends to use it for direct marketing purposes unless you have given us specific permission to do so.
PDFMaster may share Your Personal Data with Third Parties, but only in the strictly limited circumstances set out below:
We may supply Your Personal Data to Third Parties (such as our internet service providers) who help us administer our websites. These Third Parties must at all times provide the same or at least comparable level of security for Your Personal Data as PDFMaster and are bound by a legal agreement to keep protect Your Personal Data and to process it only according to PDFMaster’s specific instructions. All these third-party processors have to sign a non-disclosure agreement with us.
We may also supply Your Personal Data to government bodies and law enforcement agencies if: we are required to do so by applicable law; or, if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal procedures; to respond to any legal claims or actions; or to protect the rights of PDFMaster or its customers and the public.
           </span>
           <span class="agree_content_title">
        5. How and how long do we store Personal Data, User Files and generated data?
           </span>
            
              <span class="agree_content_body">
                In brief: We keep Your Personal Data only as long as it is needed for the provision of our services or required by law. As a registered PDFMaster user we store your User Files for your conveniences. If you do not have an account we keep your User Files long enough for you to download or process them. The time required to upload, process and convert User Files varies from tool to tool.
We will only retain Your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal, regulatory or internal policy requirements. To help us do this, we apply criteria to determine the appropriate periods for retaining Your Personal Data depending on its purpose, such as account maintenance, facilitating client relationship management, and responding to legal claims or requests from authorities. In general, PDFMaster may retain personal data for the period of your relationship or contract with us plus 10 years. An ongoing or anticipated legal or regulatory proceeding may lead to retention beyond this period.
If you have a PDFMaster account and you are logged in, it doesn’t matter if you are a paying user or not, we will save your User Files and store them in our database locally.
We have to inform you 14, 7 and 1 day in advance by sending an email if PDFMaster will delete your User Files.
All the files uploaded for processing on smallpdf.com are stored on an appropriate server infrastructure for processing and the download afterwards. The time we keep User Files varies from tool to tool, as some tools require longer saving periods (eg. eSign). In most tools we delete the files after one hour. We only store User Files and generated data for longer than an hour,
if the additional storage time is required to provide our service, for example if the recipient of a User File shared with a tool, including but not limited to our eSign tool, needs more time for downloading the User File;
for analyzing how our service is used to optimize its quality and the user experience.
           </span>
           <span class="agree_content_title">
        6. Which countries will your personal information be sent to and why?

           </span>
            
              <span class="agree_content_body">
                In brief: We transfer your personal data outside of China and ensure that your personal data is well protected irrespective of its location.
When you use our services, Your Personal Data and User Files may be transferred to and from servers located in other countries. Further, User Files (whether originally provided by you or processed by using our services) are not shared with third parties, unless such parties are subject to confidentiality obligations.
If we transfer data to a country without adequate legal data protection, we ensure an appropriate level of protection as legally required by way of using appropriate contracts or binding corporate rules or we rely on the statutory exceptions of consent, performance of contracts, the establishment, exercise or enforcement of legal claims, overriding public interests, published personal data or because it is necessary to protect the integrity of the persons concerned.

Although we put our best efforts to ensure the best quality of our services, sometimes our website may experience tough moments. We use specific services in order to track errors on PDFMaster that affect our customers.

           </span>
           <span class="agree_content_title">
        8. Can PDFMaster change the terms of this Privacy Notice?

           </span>
            
              <span class="agree_content_body">
